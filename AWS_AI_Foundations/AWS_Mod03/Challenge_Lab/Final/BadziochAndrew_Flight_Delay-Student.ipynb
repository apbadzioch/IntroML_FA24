    "# Problem: Predicting Airplane Delays\n",
    "\n",
    "The goals of this notebook are:\n",
    "- Process and create a dataset from downloaded .zip files\n",
    "- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)\n",
    "- Establish a baseline model\n",
    "- Move from a simple model to an ensemble model\n",

    "## Introduction to business scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "You work for a travel booking website that wants to improve the customer experience for flights that were delayed. The company wants to create a feature to let customers know if the flight will be delayed because of weather when they book a flight to or from the busiest airports for domestic travel in the US. \n",
    "\n",
    "You are tasked with solving part of this problem by using machine learning (ML) to identify whether the flight will be delayed because of weather. You have been given access to the a dataset about the on-time performance of domestic flights that were operated by large air carriers. You can use this data to train an ML model to predict if the flight is going to be delayed for the busiest airports.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## About this dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset contains scheduled and actual departure and arrival times reported by certified US air carriers that account for at least 1 percent of domestic scheduled passenger revenues. The data was collected by the U.S. Office of Airline Information, Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS). The dataset contains date, time, origin, destination, airline, distance, and delay status of flights for flights between 2013 and 2018.\n",

    "- Data Appropriateness Analysis: The dataset for predicting flight delays contains scheduled and actual departure and arrival times reported by certified US air carriers. It includes data on various factors such as date, time, origin, destination, airline, distance, and delay status for flights between 2013 and 2018. Here's an analysis of the appropriateness of this data:\n",
    "- Strengths\n",
    "    1. Comprehensive Coverage: The dataset covers multiple years (2013-2018) and includes flights from all major US airlines, providing a broad and diverse range of data points for training the ML model.\n",
    "    2. Relevant Features: The dataset contains essential features that are likely to impactflight delays, such as date, time, origin, destination, airline, and distance. Thesefeatures can help in identifying patterns and correlations with weather-relateddelays.\n",
    "    3. Official Source: The data is collected and compiled by the U.S. Office of Airline Information, Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), ensuring its reliability and accuracy.\n",
    "    4. Large Volume: With data spanning multiple years, the dataset provides a substantial volume of records, which is beneficial for training robust ML models.\n",
    "- Potential Challenges\n",
    "    1. Missing Values: The dataset might contain missing or incomplete records, which could affect the model's performance. Proper data cleaning and preprocessing will be necessary to address this issue.\n",
    "    2. Imbalance in Delay Status: If the proportion of delayed flights is significantly\n",
    "    smaller than on-time flights, the dataset may be imbalanced. This could lead to amodel that is biased towards predicting on-time flights. Techniques like resampling or using specialized algorithms for imbalanced data might be required.\n",
    "    3. External Factors: The dataset does not include direct weather information, which is crucial for predicting weather-related delays. Integrating external weather data from reliable sources will be necessary to improve the model's accuracy.\n",
    "    4. Temporal Changes: Flight delay patterns and airline operations may have changedover the years. Ensuring the model accounts for temporal changes and trends is important for maintaining its relevance and accuracy.\n",
    "- Conclusion: Overall, the dataset is appropriate for the task of predicting weather-related flight delays, given its comprehensive coverage, relevant features, and large volume. However,addressing potential challenges such as missing values, data imbalance, and the integration of weather data will be crucial for building an accurate and reliable ML model."

    "1. Does your model performance meet your business goal? If not, what are some things you'd like to do differently if you had more time for tuning?\n",
    "2. How much did your model improve as you made changes to your dataset, features, and hyperparameters? What types of techniques did you employ throughout this project, and which yielded the greatest improvements in your model?\n",
    "3. What were some of the biggest challenges that you encountered throughout this project?\n",
    "4. Do you have any unanswered questions about aspects of the pipeline that didn't make sense to you?\n",
    "5. What were the three most important things that you learned about machine learning while working on this project?\n",
